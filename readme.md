# AOC 2021 Answers

This is my repo for AOC answers. My goal is to practice Rust
which is a language I do not get much use out of in my day
to day work.

If you want to use this as a template for your own AOC answers,
leave only `lib.rs` and `aoc.rs`. `cargo test` must be run with
`--bin dayXX` for it to work on an incomplete repo.

`dl-input.sh` downloads the puzzle inputs. Add a `AOC_COOKIE`
variable to a cookie.env file to use it.
